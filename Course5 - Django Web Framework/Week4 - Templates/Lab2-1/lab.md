The lab exercise doesn't have the complete directories and files to run server. Only created what I needed/had to code to solve the lab.

## Goal

The learner will practice using Dynamic Templates in Django

## Objectives

- The learner will fetch dynamic content from the model inside the view

- The learner will update view created for Menu with dynamic content

- The learner will pass the dynamic content to the template and run a loop to fetch item values.

1. Create `views.py` and create a function called `menu` and import the models.
2. Create `menu.html` and using syntax for Django Template Language, create a code to show all the items and prices.
3. Run server to see if the page renders correctly.
