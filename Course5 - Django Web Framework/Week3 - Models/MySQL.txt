Start the MySQL Command Line CLI
mysql -u root -p
-> enter the password set at time of installation.

Create Database
Create database mydatabase;

show databases; -> will list the currently available databases.

Install MySQL DB API Driver - in the terminal VS Code
pip3 install mysqlclient

Enable MySQL
To be able to use MySQL, the "DATABASES" variable in the Django project’s settings file must be properly configured.
By default, it is set to the connection parameters for SQLite. Remove those statements. You have to add MySQL-specific settings in their place.
You must configure at least one database in the DATABASES variable. For the configuration of the first database, its name should be ‘default’.
The settings include the database engine, name of the database, username, and password, along with the host IP address.
This defaults to the localhost 127.0.0.10 and the port defaults to 3306.

*** settings.py ***
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'mydatabase',
        'USER': 'root',
        'PASSWORD': '',
        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
        'PORT': '3306',
        'OPTIONS': {
            'init_command': "SET sql_mode='STRICT_TRANS_TABLES'"
        }
    }
}

The other optional parameters include:
* sql_mode: The session SQL mode will be set to the given string. It defaults to 'STATIC_TRANS_TABLES' to prevent invalid or missing
            values from being stored in the database.
* default-character-set: The character set to be used. Default is utf8.
* read_default_file: MySQL configuration file to read.
* init_command: Initial command to issue to the server upon connection.



Create database tables
The startprojecttemplate installs some Django apps by default. Some examples include admin, auth and sessions.
Remember that you need to create the necessary database tables for these apps.
Run the migrate command to use the models in these apps and build their respective table structure in the current mysql database.

python manage.py migrate

Inside the MySQL terminal, run the following commands:
use mydatabase;
Show tables;

Install MySQL (Jun Han) extension
click on + button next to MYSQL on the left pane and enter the following details:
domain name: localhost
user:root
password=''.

Note: Some users may encounter an error such as:
Client does not support authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL client

This usually indicates a user privilege issue. In such cases first run a command such as:

     ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';

Then refresh privileges by running a command such as:

     flush privileges;

Now, the localhost appears in the explorer bar.

Expand the section by selecting the drop-down arrow and choose mydatabase. All the tables required for the INSTALLED_APPS will be visible.
