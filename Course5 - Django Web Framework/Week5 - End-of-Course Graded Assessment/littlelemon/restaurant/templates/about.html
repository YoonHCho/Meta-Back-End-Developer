          Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family owned
          Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served with a
          modern twist.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture
          and have a menu of 12-15 items that they rotate seasonally.
        </p>

        <p>
          The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate
          prices, making it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.
        </p>

        <p>
          Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who
          moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a
          restaurant.
        </p>

        <p>
          To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience
          as a chef in Italy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to
          expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional
          cuisines from the mediterranean region.
