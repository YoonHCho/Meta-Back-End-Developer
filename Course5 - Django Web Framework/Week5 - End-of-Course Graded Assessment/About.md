# About the final graded project assessment for Django Web Framework

```
Introduction
Congratulations on coming this far in your journey with working in Django!

This graded assessment is one of your final steps to test the skills and understanding you acquired with the Django framework.

While the difficulty level is subjective to a learner based on many factors, patience and perseverance are key to working with any back-end framework. Good luck!

Goal

The Course Assessment will require learner to build the two pages of the web app and be split majorly into two parts:

1. Create the Menu page

2. Create the Menu Item page


Learner Instructions
The Little Lemon website will consist of five pages:

- Home
- About
- Booking
- Menu
- Menu Item

To complete this graded assessment, you will need to modify the following files:

- settings.py
- urls.py (app-level)
- models.py
- views.py
- admin.py
- templates/menu.html
- templates/menu_item.html
- templates/partials/_footer.html
```

In this course, you will be assessed in two ways. You will complete the peer-reviewed Little Lemon restaurant project and a final graded quiz.

## The purpose of the assessments

The primary purpose of the assessments is to check your knowledge and understanding of the key learning objectives of the course.

Most importantly, they help you establish which topics you have mastered and which topics require further focus before completing the course. Ultimately, the graded assessments are designed to help you make sure that you can apply what you have learned.

## What to expect from the graded quiz

The quiz tests only the topics covered throughout the course so there shouldnâ€™t be any surprises. Please review the feedback on your answers and where necessary go back and work through the topics that you feel require your further attention.

## What to expect from the Little Lemon Django project

You have encountered exercises, knowledge checks, in-video questions and other assessments throughout this course. Nothing in the Django project will be outside of the scope of what you have already learned, so you should be well placed to succeed.

You will combine the skills and knowledge that you applied throughout the course and use them to build a website for the Little Lemon restaurant.

Little Lemon is a charming neighborhood bistro that serves simple food and classic cocktails in a lively but casual environment. The restaurant features a locally sourced menu with daily specials.

The restaurant is in the process of transition from a one-page website to a database driven web application using the Django framework. Currently, the pages for Home, About and Book are completed.

For the menu page, the owners would like to store the menu information in a database that can be updated as the menu changes seasonally.

Managers need to be able to add or update menu by changing details for the name, description, price, or photo.

This information will be displayed on a dedicated menu item page that will load when the users click on a menu item
https://
from the Menu page.

## How to prepare for the graded assessment

The videos about creating models, foreign keys, view functions, template inheritance and the Django template language offer valuable guidance on how to prepare for the project.

In addition it's a good idea to ensure that you have mastered the skills covered in the following exercises:

- Exercise: Creating a view and URL configuration

- Exercise: Mapping URLs with Params

- Exercise: Creating URLs and Mapping to Views

- Exercise: Models and migrations

- Exercise: Models using Foreign Keys

- Exercise: Using Django Admin

- Exercise: Creating Dynamic Templates

- Exercise: Working with Templates

## How will I get feedback on my Django project?

This is a peer-review project, which means that your website and code will be evaluated by your fellow learners. Of course, this means that you will also need to give feedback to your peers and grade their websites. In this way, you can learn from other learners' ideas and the issues that they may have encountered.

The rest of this lesson will guide you on how best to approach the development of your Django project.

Good luck!
