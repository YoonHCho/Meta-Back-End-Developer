So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot air-planes. I have flown a little over
all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I
can distinguish China from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.
In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have
been concerned with matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have
seen them intimately, close at hand. And that hasnâ€™t much improved my opinion of them.
